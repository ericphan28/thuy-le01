## 🎯 **CRITICAL BUG FIXES COMPLETED**

### **Pricing System Bug (SP000049):**
```
❌ Previous Issue: SP000049 showing 215,000₫ instead of 190,000₫
✅ Root Cause: Tag rules (Rule #667) incorrectly overriding SKU rules (Rule #1)
✅ Solution: Fixed engine.ts tag scope matching logic
✅ Result: Proper priority-based rule application

Technical Details:
- Rule #1: net 190,000₫ (priority 100, qty 1-30) ✅ CORRECT
- Rule #667: amount 5,000₫ HOT tag (priority 120) ❌ DISABLED  
- Rule #672: amount 5,000₫ (qty 3+) - Still active
- Fix: Disabled tag rule matching to prevent conflicts
```

### **UI/UX Improvements:**
```
✅ Rule ID display (#1, #667) for easy debugging
